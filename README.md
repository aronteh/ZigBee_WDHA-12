# ZigBee_WDHA-12

ZigBee modification for WDHA-12 Homelink gateway  

### Usage:
To reset ZigBee hold buttons 1,2,3 until all 3 LEDs are lit and hold for 2+ seconds.  

SHOCK HAZARD, internal power supply is not isolated, do not touch circuitry while plugged in.  
DO NOT plug into AC mains for CC debugger programming.  Use only 9V battery and hold a button down so 3.3V supply stays active, otherwise damage will result!
